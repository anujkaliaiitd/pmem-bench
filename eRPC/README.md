eRPC is a fast and general-purpose RPC library for datacenter networks.
Our NSDI 2019 [paper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~akalia/doc/nsdi19/erpc_nsdi19.pdf)
describes the system in detail.
[Documentation](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~akalia/erpc_doc) is available online.

Some highlights:
 * Multiple supported networks: Ethernet, InfiniBand, and RoCE
 * Low latency: 2.3 microseconds round-trip RPC latency with UDP over Ethernet
 * Performance for small 32-byte RPCs: ~10M RPCs/sec with one CPU core,
   60--80M RPCs/sec with one NIC.
 * Bandwidth for large RPC: 75 Gbps on one connection (one CPU core at server
   and client) for 8 MB RPCs
 * Scalability: 20000 RPC sessions per server
 * End-to-end congestion control that tolerates 100-way incasts
 * Nested RPCs, and long-running background RPCs
 * A port of [Raft](https://github.com/willemt/raft) as an example. Our 3-way
   replication latency is 5.3 microseconds with traditional UDP over Ethernet.

## Requirements
 * Toolchain: A C++11 compiler and CMake 2.8+
 * See `scripts/packages/` for required software packages for your distro. 
   Install _exactly one_ of the following, mutually-incompatible packages:
   * Mellanox OFED for Mellanox NICs
   * System-wide DPDK for other, DPDK-compatible NICs
 * NICs: Fast (10 GbE+) bare-metal NICs are needed for good performance. eRPC
   works best with Mellanox Ethernet and InfiniBand NICs. Any DPDK-capable NICs
   also work well. Slower/virtual NICs can still be used for testing and
   development.
 * System configuration:
   * At least 1024 huge pages on every NUMA node, and unlimited SHM limits
   * On a machine with `n` eRPC processes, eRPC uses kernel UDP ports
     `{31850, ..., 31850 + n - 1}.` These ports should be open on the management
     network. See `scripts/firewalld/erpc_firewall.sh` for systems running
     `firewalld`.

## eRPC quickstart
 * Build and run the test suite:
   `cmake . -DPERF=OFF -DTRANSPORT=infiniband; make -j; sudo ctest`.
   * `DPERF=OFF` enables debugging, which greatly reduces performance. Set
     `DPERF=ON` for performance measurements.
   * Here, `infiniband` should be replaced with `raw` for Mellanox Ethernet
     NICs, or `dpdk` for Intel Ethernet NICs.
   * A machine with two ports is needed to run the unit tests if DPDK is chosen.
     Run `scripts/run-tests-dpdk.sh` instead of `ctest`.
 * Run the `hello_world` application:
   * `cd hello_world`
   * Edit the server and client hostnames in `common.h` 
   * Based on the transport that eRPC was compiled for, compile `hello_world`
     using `make infiniband`, `make raw`, or `make dpdk`.
   * Run `./server` at the server, and `./client` at the client
 * Generate the documentation: `doxygen`

## Supported bare-metal NICs:
 * Ethernet/UDP mode:
   * ConnectX-4 or newer Mellanox Ethernet NICs: Use `DTRANSPORT=raw`
   * DPDK-compatible NICs that support flow-director: Use `DTRANSPORT=dpdk`
     * Intel 82599 and Intel X710 NICs have been tested
     * Virtual NICs have not been tested
     * `raw` transport is faster for Mellanox NICs, which also support DPDK
   * ConnectX-3 Ethernet NICs are supported in eRPC's RoCE mode
 * RDMA (InfiniBand/RoCE) NICs: Use `DTRANSPORT=infiniband`. Add `DROCE=on`
   if using RoCE.
 * Mellanox drivers optimized specially for eRPC are available in the `drivers`
   directory

## Running eRPC without fast bare-metal NICs:
 * Follow these instructions to try out eRPC on a machine without fast Mellanox
   or DPDK-capable NICs (e.g., on your desktop or in a virtual machine). This is
   for development only: eRPC is not designed to perform well in these settings.
   eRPC has been tested on KVM virtual machines and in Amazon EC2.
 * Create an emulated RoCE device with [SoftRoCE] (instructions soon).
 * Compile eRPC with `DTRANSPORT=infiniband -DROCE=on`

## Configuring and running the provided applications
 * The `apps` directory contains a suite of benchmarks and examples. The
   instructions below are for this suite of applications. eRPC can also be
   simply linked as a library instead (see `hello_world/` for an example).
 * To build an application, create `scripts/autorun_app_file` and change its
   contents to one of the available directory names in `apps/`. See
   `scripts/example_autorun_app_file` for an example. Then generate a
   Makefile using `cmake . -DPERF=ON -DTRANSPORT=raw/infiniband/dpdk`. 
 * Each application directory in `apps/` contains a config file
   that must specify all flags defined in `apps/apps_common.h`. For example,
   `num_processes` specifies the total number of eRPC processes in the cluster.
 * The URIs of eRPC processes in the cluster are specified in
   `scripts/autorun_process_file`. Each line in this file must be
   `<hostname> <management udp port> <numa_node>`.
 * Run `scripts/do.sh` for each process:
   * With single-CPU machines: `num_processes` machines are needed.
     Run `scripts/do.sh <i> 0` on machine `i` in `{0, ..., num_processes - 1}`.
   * With dual-CPU machines: `num_machines = ceil(num_processes / 2)` machines
     are needed. Run `scripts/do.sh <i> <i % 2>` on machine i in
     `{0, ..., num_machines - 1}`.
 * To automatically run an application at all processes in
   `scripts/autorun_process_file`, run `scripts/run-all.sh`. For some
   applications, statistics generated in a run can be collected and processed
   using `scripts/proc-out.sh`.

## Getting help
 * GitHub issues are preferred over email. Please include the following
   information in the issue:
   * NIC model
   * Mellanox OFED or DPDK version
   * Operating system
